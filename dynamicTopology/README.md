Dynamic network topology can also be easily implemented by writing Linux shell scripts. Running running-dynamicTopology.sh can achieve dynamic changes in the network topology. The script first executes topology-01.sh to create the initial network topology. After 20 seconds, it runs topology-03.sh, which removes certain inter-satellite links and creates other inter-satellite links to implement changes in the network topology. Friends can use topology-03.sh as a reference to write topology-04.sh, topology-05.sh, and so on, and then include topology-04.sh, topology-05.sh as commands within running-dynamicTopology.sh. The commands in the topology-02.sh file are meant to delete all inter-satellite links created by topology-01.sh, and these commands are provided for your reference.
